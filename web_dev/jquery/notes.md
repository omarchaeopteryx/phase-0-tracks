# Notes for now to learn jQuery rapidly

My goal is to take a multi-dimensional approach to learning jQuery. I'll start by **getting a handle on "what it is"** by reading from a **text-heavy resource**, such as Wikipedia or someone's blog, for 10-20 minutes. I'll then find a place to **"sandbox" some ideas** to test out the code -- it's likely there's a place on the Web that can offer this.

Then, I'll play around while trying to accomplish **some kind of goal** -- whether large or small -- but a task-specific challenge that will allow me to pull in the necessary resources to solve it. Whether that's a **cheat-sheet**, or **watching a YouTube video** for this specific task (I'll try to consult both), the end goal should be clear.

For me, it'll help at that point to even know "What to Google"!

I'll be sure to take a break in between. I work well by setting a timer and stopping for a short time as well. In this case I think I'll do 50 minutes learning, 10 break, and 50 minutes again. The last 10 will be flexible.

*Note that this is based on what we have learned in this course so far, in addition to my own knowledge of my style.*

## Afterword

I found a couple resources to be the most useful after exploring the concept initially. The W3C website has a nice "cheat-sheet" way of listing selectors, and this was useful for helping me understand the patterns and the syntax. In addition, I felt gratified when I could try it for myself in an editor (big help!). I also watched a short YouTube video at the end that was very helpful.
