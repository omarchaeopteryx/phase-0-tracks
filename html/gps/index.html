<!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to make dividing elements easier to read for the user. They'll certainly come in handy when doing more advanced CSS work later on in the page-building process... I think creating "sections" and "sections" going to be the most useful. 

Although each browser may load information differently, generally speaking the browser likely uses the higher-order blocks and semantic tags to display first, and then presents the lower-order, nested block elements and in-line elements. For instance, it'll read `header`, `main`, `body`, `footer`, and then load the elements within the body. 

I learned that Sublime is handy for saving time and tediousness for coders. I'm impressed with the snippet technique and will definitely make some in the future
! My partner and I outlined how to make a "table" snippet in our GPS session.

The most difficult concept in this challenge was understanding the hierarchy of the semantic elements and knnowing in which order to nest them. We had to ask our guide for clarification on this issue (e.g., `body` vs `main` in terms of the outline). I think I can improve my understanding by looking at specific examples of the semantic tags and using them more. -->
