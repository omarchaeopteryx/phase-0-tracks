# input elements

Here are some elements and tags we've come across in example.form.html:

<fieldset> = a way of showing a relationship between form controls
<div> = it can be used to group elements, and for styling purposes (important for CSS)
<label> = text description of the input; helpful for accessibility 
<input> = data input in a form; takes `type`
	* can change `type` to "checkbox" to create a checkbox with `name`, `value`, `checked`
	* can change `type` to "date" to create a calendar selection tool; takes `name`
	* can change `type` to "password" to hide the typed information; takes `name`
	* can change `type` to "text" for plain text; takes "name" and "placeholder"
<button> = creates a clickable button with element `type`
	* can change `type` to "subit" for a submission button

<select> = creates a drop-down list that contains two or more elements; takes `name`
<option> = sub-items of the <select> tag drop-down list; takes `value`; (kind of like list item)
