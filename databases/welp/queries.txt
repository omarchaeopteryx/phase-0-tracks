You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM review LEFT JOIN businesses ON review.business_id=businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON review.user_id=users.id;

1|3|Service was ok|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Bedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|4|Service was good|2|2|2|Amir's Towing|2|Angela|Jolie
3|5|Service was great|3|3|3|Lotta's Yoga|3|Seven|Wonder


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.First_Name, users.Last_Name , businesses.Name,review.rating, review.comments FROM review LEFT JOIN businesses ON review.business_id=businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON review.user_id=users.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT * FROM review LEFT JOIN businesses ON review.business_id=businesses.id LEFT JOIN users ON review.user_id=users.id WHERE business_id=1;
