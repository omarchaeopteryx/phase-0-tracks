# Pseudocode

# Build an empty hash structure.

# Ask an interior designer to enter the details of a client.

# Go through a list of questions, including string and numerical and boolean answers, and store the answers.

# # Be sure to convert answers to appropriate types (string, integer, etc).

# When done, PRINT the hash.

# Ask user if they want to update anything in the list.

## If yes, ask which KEY, then ask for the VALUE of that KEY and then change that KEY's value.

## If 'none' skip to below.

# PRINT the new hash.
